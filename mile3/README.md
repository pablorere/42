### [philosophers](./philosophers/) - The Dining Philosophers Problem

A classic computer science problem that teaches thread synchronization, resource sharing, and deadlock prevention.

#### üéØ Objective
Simulate the dining philosophers problem where N philosophers sit around a table, alternating between eating, thinking, and sleeping, while sharing N forks between them.

#### üìù The Problem
**Setup:**
- N philosophers sit around a circular table
- N forks are placed between philosophers (one between each pair)
- Philosophers alternate between three states: eating, thinking, sleeping
- A philosopher needs TWO forks to eat
- Philosophers cannot communicate with each other

**Rules:**
- A philosopher must pick up both adjacent forks to eat
- After eating, they put down both forks and sleep
- After sleeping, they think
- A philosopher dies if they don't start eating within `time_to_die` ms
- The simulation stops when a philosopher dies

#### üìù Program Requirements
**Usage:**
```bash
./philo number_of_philosophers time_to_die time_to_eat time_to_sleep [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]
```

**Arguments:**
- `number_of_philosophers` - Number of philosophers (and forks)
- `time_to_die` - Time in ms after which a philosopher dies if not eating
- `time_to_eat` - Time in ms a philosopher spends eating
- `time_to_sleep` - Time in ms a philosopher spends sleeping
- `[optional]` - Number of times each philosopher must eat to end simulation

#### üõ† Technical Concepts

**Threading Concepts:**
- **pthread_create** - Creating threads for each philosopher
- **pthread_join** - Waiting for thread completion
- **pthread_detach** - Managing thread lifecycle
- **Thread safety** - Protecting shared resources

**Synchronization Primitives:**
- **Mutexes** - Protecting shared resources (forks, output)
- **pthread_mutex_lock/unlock** - Critical section protection
- **pthread_mutex_init/destroy** - Mutex lifecycle management
- **Atomic operations** - Safe variable access

**Concurrent Programming:**
- **Race conditions** - Multiple threads accessing shared data
- **Deadlock prevention** - Avoiding circular wait conditions
- **Resource allocation** - Fair distribution of limited resources
- **Timing precision** - Accurate time measurements and delays

#### üéØ Key Challenges

**Deadlock Prevention:**
- **Problem:** All philosophers pick up left fork simultaneously
- **Solutions:** 
  - Asymmetric approach (odd/even philosophers)
  - Resource ordering
  - Timeout mechanisms

**Race Condition Management:**
- **Problem:** Multiple threads accessing shared state
- **Solution:** Proper mutex usage and critical sections

**Timing Accuracy:**
- **Problem:** Precise timing for death detection
- **Solution:** High-resolution timers and regular monitoring

**Resource Sharing:**
- **Problem:** Fair fork distribution
- **Solution:** Proper synchronization and allocation strategies

#### üí° Implementation Strategies

**Basic Approach:**
1. Create one thread per philosopher
2. Use mutexes to represent forks
3. Implement eating, sleeping, thinking cycle
4. Monitor for death conditions

**Advanced Optimizations:**
- **Monitoring Thread** - Separate thread for death detection
- **State Tracking** - Efficient philosopher state management
- **Performance Tuning** - Minimize unnecessary delays

## üìã Evaluation Criteria

### Mandatory Requirements
- ‚úÖ No philosopher should die (unless intended)
- ‚úÖ Philosophers alternate between eating, sleeping, thinking
- ‚úÖ Proper fork sharing (no philosopher eats without 2 forks)
- ‚úÖ Accurate timing and death detection
- ‚úÖ Thread-safe output and resource access

### Performance Requirements
- ‚úÖ Handle 1-200 philosophers efficiently
- ‚úÖ Accurate timing within 10ms precision
- ‚úÖ No unnecessary delays or busy waiting
- ‚úÖ Proper resource cleanup on termination

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ‚ùå Data races on shared variables
- ‚ùå Deadlock conditions
- ‚ùå Inaccurate timing calculations
- ‚ùå Memory leaks with threads
- ‚ùå Improper mutex usage

## üéØ Tips for Success

### Design Strategy
1. **Understand the Problem** - Study the classic dining philosophers
2. **Start Simple** - Implement basic version first
3. **Add Synchronization** - Introduce mutexes gradually
4. **Test Edge Cases** - Single philosopher, large numbers

### Implementation Tips
1. **Use Proper Data Structures** - Organize philosopher and fork data
2. **Implement Monitoring** - Separate death detection logic
3. **Handle Timing Carefully** - Use microsecond precision
4. **Test Thoroughly** - Various philosopher counts and timings

### Debugging Concurrent Code
1. **Use Thread Debugging Tools** - GDB with thread support
2. **Add Logging** - Trace thread execution (with locks!)
3. **Test Race Conditions** - Stress test with many iterations
4. **Verify Synchronization** - Ensure proper mutex usage

## üîß Common Challenges & Solutions
