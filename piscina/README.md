# Piscina - The Pool üèä

**Duration: 4 weeks intensive**

Welcome to the Piscina! This is the selection process and preparation phase of 42 School, where candidates dive deep into the fundamentals of C programming and Unix systems.

## üéØ What is the Piscina?

The Piscina (Portuguese/Spanish for "pool") is 42's intensive 4-week selection process. It's called "the pool" because you're thrown into the deep end of programming, learning to swim through trial by fire, peer learning, and continuous practice.

### Key Characteristics:

- **Peer-to-Peer** - No teachers, learn from fellow candidates
- **Sink or Swim** - Fast-paced, challenging environment
- **Community Building** - Form lasting friendships and study groups
- **Selection Process** - Determines admission to the main curriculum

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of the Piscina, you will have:

- ‚úÖ Learned fundamental C programming concepts
- ‚úÖ Mastered Unix command line and shell scripting
- ‚úÖ Developed problem-solving and debugging skills
- ‚úÖ Experienced peer learning and collaboration
- ‚úÖ Built resilience and adaptability
- ‚úÖ Understood the 42 methodology and culture
