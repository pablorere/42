This repository contains my journey through the 42 School curriculum, a peer-to-peer learning program that teaches programming through hands-on projects without traditional teachers or courses.

## 🎯 About 42 School

42 is an innovative coding school that uses project-based learning where students learn from each other. The curriculum is designed to develop both technical skills and problem-solving abilities through increasingly complex programming challenges.

## 📚 Curriculum Overview

The 42 curriculum is organized into different phases, each building upon the previous one:

## 📋 Prerequisites

To succeed in the 42 curriculum:

- **Basic computer literacy**
- **Logical thinking and problem-solving skills**
- **Patience and persistence**
- **Willingness to collaborate and help peers**
- **Time management skills**

No prior programming experience is required, but helpful.

## 🎖 Grading System

42 uses a unique peer-evaluation system where students evaluate each other's projects. Projects are graded from 0 to 125 points:

- **0-59**: Failed
- **60-84**: Passed
- **85-100**: Excellent
- **101-125**: Outstanding (with bonus parts)

## 📈 Progress Tracking

| Phase | Status | Projects Completed | Average Score |
|-------|--------|-------------------|---------------|
| Piscina | ✅ Completed | 6+ projects | 100% |
| Mile 0 | ✅ Completed | 1/1 | 125/125 |
| Mile 1 | 🚧 In Progress | 2/2 | - |
| Mile 2 | 🚧 In Progress | 3/3 | - |
| Mile 3 | 🚧 In Progress | 1/2 | - |

## 🤝 Peer Learning Philosophy

The 42 methodology emphasizes:

- **No teachers**: Students learn from each other
- **Project-based learning**: Practical application over theory
- **Peer evaluation**: Students grade each other's work
- **Collaborative environment**: Helping others helps yourself
- **Self-directed learning**: Taking responsibility for your education
